{"title": "ANT 3820 - Anthropology of Media (3)  ", "description": "In this course, we consider from an anthropological perspective the nature and force of mass media in cultural life. The anthropology of media can be understood as a natural history of the human senses in relation to science and technology, while additionally considering these shifts in connection to social and political phenomena. As we map this particular history of the senses primarily through ethnographies and other literary forms, we want to keep in mind these questions: (1) What structural, psychic, and social forms of life are made possible by the technologization, and more recently, the electronification of communication in various milieus? (2) How does the materiality of media itself transform the human experience of space-time? (3) What is the role of media in the production of difference and understandings of the self? This is a theory-driven course with a lab component, where students will be asked to explore philosophical questions through multimedia projects produced in the Ethnography Lab. "},

Or, to put it another way, the intersection of nature and culture. Environmental anthropologists examine how different sociocultural groups - from hunter-gatherers in the Amazon to rangers in national parks in the United States - have conceptualized, categorized, valued, and acted upon the non-human world. We will explore theories, methods, and applications of environmental anthropology. The field examines issues of vital concern today: how humans shape and are shaped by our surroundings. "},

{"title": "ANT 3635 - Political Anthropology (3) [WID] ", "description": "This course brings an anthropological lens to bear on the study of politics as practiced by cultures around the world with a special focus upon the topic of democracy. While much scholarship has addressed the more formal aspects of so-called “democratic transitions” (e.g. regime shifts, political parties and formal political institutions), only recently has scholarly attention in anthropology turned to considerations of lived experiences and the contingent nature of political subjectivities borne out in contemporary societies. Case studies are drawn from a range of contemporary theorizations of democracy and related concepts such as globalization, transnationalism, citizenship, economic development, and identity politics. "},
{"title": "ANT 3630 - Epistemology and Praxis (3) [WID] ", "description": "Representation and the epistemological problems inherent to it are key anthropological problems of the 21st century. Instead of studying identifiable, rooted communities, anthropologists have turned their attention to the rhetorical construction underpinning the very ideas and practices sustaining the experiences of rootedness and group identity. In a world marked more than ever by the politics of identity, access to resources is often predicated on establishing a clear membership in recognizable groups. This seminar will offer students a critical understanding of the construction of ‘truth’ which bolsters or provides obstacles to claims of membership and includes a discussion of the precarious nature of engagement which disrupts the balance between academic rigor and solidarity.

Students will look at case studies from North Carolina while also taking a comparative perspective through international case studies. "},
{"title": "ANT 3600 - Archaeological Theory (3) [WID] ", "description": "How do archaeologists interpret the past from the material artifacts and sites we uncover in the present? How do our interpretations speak to wider anthropological discussions of human biology, history, language, and culture? And does archaeology matter? In this course we address these questions through a critical foray into the conceptual and theoretical foundations of anthropological archaeology-from its colonial roots, through its maturation as a discipline in the 20th century, to its ongoing diversification today. We also explore how archaeology draws on and contributes to public conversations and intellectual trends across the social sciences and humanities. "},
{"title": "ANT 3560 - Archaic States (3)  ", "description": "Archaeology is uniquely positioned to explore the (pre)history of complex political regimes-what we now call the State-through the study of material culture, human remains, and spatial order. This course will adopt a comparative approach to “archaic” forms of the State as we address three interrelated questions: How does the State emerge in different times and places over the past several millennia? How does the State draw on diverse sources of power to institute the authority of the few over the many? And how does the State intersect with social identities and communities of people subject to or beyond its rule? We will also consider whether our own experience of political power must always frame our responses to these questions-in other words, how can archaeology offer historical visions of the State that are not simply crude reflections of the modern world?

{"title": "ANT 3555 - Ceramics for the Archaeologist (3)  ", "description": "Fragile yet indestructible, ceramic artifacts are a significant portion of the archaeological record around the world. Through careful analysis, archaeologists use ceramics to date assemblages and sites, trace production through craft economies, untangle ancient exchange networks, and infer the social identities of potters.

Course may be taught as a field course in Costa Rica, Indonesia, or other primate habitat countries. "},
{"title": "ANT 2440 - From Savages to Cyborgs (3)  ", "description": "This course is about monsters, and how monstrosity blends together realms that should be kept separate - such as nature/culture, human/animal, male/female, material/immaterial, and self/other. The very beginnings of anthropology can be traced to the impetus for discovery of otherness, in an unyielding attempt to find, know and subdue others. Despite the Enlightenment project to classify and thus distance the perceived threat of the “savage-primitive”, the figure of the monster shape shifts. People who are cast as less than human - savages, gang members, criminals, terrorists, post-human cyborgs, people with AIDS - embody the nexus of debates about causality and cure. In this course, we pursue the monster as it is imagined and emerges through the medium of film - from early ethnographic films of the 20th century, documentary films on outcast figures, and popular film.

{"title": "ANT 2340 - Bronze Age Civilizations (3) [GenEd: SS] ", "description": "What explains the rise and fall of past civilizations? How did the first cities promote increasingly global scales of economic and cultural interaction? And how do early states and empires reflect on our own experience of citizenship and globalization in the 21st century? This course follows in the footsteps of archaeologists to explore these questions through a comparative survey of ruins, artifacts, and texts from complex societies across Eurasia during the so-called Bronze Age circa 3500-1000 BCE. Focusing on case studies from Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, Scandinavia, India, and China, the course lectures and readings will outline common trajectories, historical differences, and growing interconnections among the ancient societies of these regions. "},
{"title": "ANT 2330 - Neandertals (3)  ", "description": "This course studies Homo sapiens neanderthalensis from a paleoanthropological perspective. Based on recent DNA evidence, Nean- dertals are currently considered to be a subspecies of Homo sapiens sapiens. Yet they are still largely mischaracterized and remain something of an enigma - why is this? Why did Neandertals disappear so quickly as Homo sapiens sapiens spread throughout the world between 50,000-30,000 years ago even though they had successfully survived very cold pulses of the Late Pleistocene 200,000 years ago or more? This course examines the adaptation of Neandertals from biological, technological, social, and ecological evidence in order to answer these and other related questions. "},

Was Atlantis the ultimate source of all ancient civilizations? Did astronauts help the Egyptians and Mayans build their pyramids? Do we have unequivocal evidence for Noah’s Ark? In each of these cases, we will consider how archaeologists use scientific methods to evaluate evidence put forth to explain past events and cultural achievements.
